# Computational Mathematics VRG at the University of Georgia, Fall 2016

The computational mathematics VRG at the University of Georgia provides an opportunity for our graduate students to develop useful programming skills to complement their research programs.

The premise of this VRG was that many students have need to do computation and to crate mathematical software, but don’t necessarily have the grounding in programming and software engineering needed to make code which is easy to debug and easy to reuse. The plan of the course is to take graduate students needing to use computation as part of their research, and give them a space in which to work on their projects, and receive individual technical instruction as needed. This semester’s group included students pursuing the following types of projects

- learning SAGE/python
- using MATLAB for image processing
- writing educational websites for elementary school mathematics education (HTML/javascript)
- developing packages in Macaulay2
- implementing algorithms in knot theory (SAGE/GAP)
